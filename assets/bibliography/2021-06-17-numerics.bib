	abstract = {1. Introduction.— 1·0. The object of this paper is to develop methods where by the differential equations of physics may be applied more freely than hitherto in the approximate form of difference equations to problems concerning irregular bodies. Though very different in method, it is in purpose a continuation of a former paper by the author, on a “Freehand Graphic Way of Determining Stream Lines and Equipotentials” (‘Phil. Mag.,’February, 1908; also ‘Proc. Physical Soc.,’ London, vol. xxi.). And all that was there said, as to the need for new methods, may be taken to apply here also. In brief, analytical methods are the foundation of the whole subject, and in practice they are the most accurate when they will work, but in the integration of partial equations, with reference to irregular-shaped boundaries, their field of application is very limited.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-73490-5},
	abstract = {Numerical analysis presents different faces to the world. For mathematicians it is a bona fide mathematical theory with an applicable flavour. For scientists and engineers it is a practical, applied subject, part of the standard repertoire of modelling techniques. For computer scientists it is a theory on the interplay of computer architecture and algorithms for real-number calculations. The tension between these standpoints is the driving force of this book, which presents a rigorous account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The exposition maintains a balance between theoretical, algorithmic and applied aspects. This second edition has been extensively updated, and includes new chapters on emerging subject areas: geometric numerical integration, spectral methods and conjugate gradients. Other topics covered include multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; finite difference and finite elements techniques for the Poisson equation; and a variety of algorithms to solve large, sparse algebraic systems.},

	abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of "no free lunch" ({NFL}) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the {NFL} theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori "head-to-head" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the {NFL} theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},

The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a “balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called “control volume;” by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

@book{ernTheoryPracticeFinite2013,
	title = {Theory and Practice of Finite Elements},
	isbn = {978-1-4757-4355-5},
	abstract = {The origins of the finite element method can be traced back to the 1950s when engineers started to solve numerically structural mechanics problems in aeronautics. Since then, the field of applications has widened steadily and nowadays encompasses nonlinear solid mechanics, fluid/structure interactions, flows in industrial or geophysical settings, multicomponent reactive turbulent flows, mass transfer in porous media, viscoelastic flows in medical sciences, electromagnetism, wave scattering problems, and option pricing (to cite a few examples). Numerous commercial and academic codes based on the finite element method have been developed over the years. The method has been so successful to solve Partial Differential Equations ({PDEs}) that the term "Finite Element Method" nowadays refers not only to the mere interpolation technique it is, but also to a fuzzy set of {PDEs} and approximation techniques. The efficiency of the finite element method relies on two distinct ingredi ents: the interpolation capability of finite elements (referred to as the approx imability property in this book) and the ability of the user to approximate his model (mostly a set of {PDEs}) in a proper mathematical setting (thus guar anteeing continuity, stability, and consistency properties). Experience shows that failure to produce an approximate solution with an acceptable accuracy is almost invariably linked to departure from the mathematical foundations. Typical examples include non-physical oscillations, spurious modes, and lock ing effects. In most cases, a remedy can be designed if the mathematical framework is properly set up.},
