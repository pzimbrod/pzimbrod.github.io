No matter where you're asking around within the industry nowadays, there's a good chance that the majority of people will tell you that digitalization and hence simulation is an "evergreen" trend in product development.

In a world where there's a company trying to sell you "the best simulation tool on the planet" around every other corner, you'd also be forgiven to think that some numerical methods are just clearly better than others.

Truthfully, every tool or method or behind it has its niche where it shines. The job as a scientist / engineer is primarily to find the best tool for the job whilst keeping an open mind. Otherwise you'd soon be too narrowed down on one solution, or in the words of the famous Abraham Maslow <d-cite key="maslowPsychologyBeing2013"></d-cite>:

> "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."

If you'd like to know a little more about the "big players" on numerical modelling in detail, I've composed separate posts on the charmes and caveats of the [Finite Difference](../fdm), [Finite Volume](../fvm) and [Finite Element Method](../fem).

Leaving all good marketing aside - isn't there one clear "winner" amongst those? Can't there just conveniently be one method that does it all?

The answer to this question is at the same time remarkably simple and complicated at the same time. Wolpert and Macready have put this in a beautifully elegant way that has become famous as one formulation of a "no free lunch theorem" <d-cite key="wolpertNoFreeLunch1997"></d-cite>:

> "[...] for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. "

This fact about optimization algorithms (and this is what numerical PDE solvers ultimately are) gives a useful introduction and baseline to our following discussion. From this point, to simplify things, we will talk about techniques for numerical modelling of partial differential equations (PDEs) when mentioning the term simulation.

So when you're trying to solve a physical phenomenon that is modelled by a PDE, you are not to expect that the (mathematically) optimal choice of algorithm for this problem will perform equally well in another type of problem. That is, in short, the simple part of our answer.

The more specific answer lies in the nature of PDEs. When talking about equations of second order - which, surprisingly, an overwhelming fraction of real world physical phenomena is covered by - we can make a classification into three separate types: hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. If you're more into the mathematics behind, I suggest some sort of introductory book on analysis.

Depending on the terms occuring in the physics you're modelling, it can be advantageous to chose one method over the other as some parts of the equation might impact convergence in a severe manner.
For example, the Continuous Galerkin Finite Element method has been used successfully for dealing with elliptic and parabolic problems, especially for solid mechanics and heat conduction problems. However, this very method struggles when modelling hyperbolic problems such as the Navier Stokes equations, or in general physics involving convection for that matter <d-cite key="ernTheoryPracticeFinite2013"></d-cite>.
In contrast, almost the opposite can be said for the Finite Volume method. It is not without reason that this approach until today is the most prevalent for modelling flow problems. At the same time, calculating problems in solid mechanics can be done as well, but yields notably worse results regarding performance and exactness when compared to the Finite Element Method.

So interestingly enough, our no free lunch theorem (in a much more hand-waving and non rigorous way) does hold again for making up one's mind for choosing the right tool for the job. You can either try to do the calculations by hand - which often enough gives surprisingly valid results with only a few simplifications - or you can resort back to the numerical methods we've lined out. Though, you most likely not get around thoroughly investigating the nature of your problem if you want to obtain accurate results in reasonable time. So again, there's no free lunch with either choice.
