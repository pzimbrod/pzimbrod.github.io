This project is kindly funded by the [Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy](https://www.stmwi.bayern.de/en/).

We aim to establish an online process monitoring system based on various optical, acoustic and chemical sensors for reliable quality prediction during additive manufacturing.
With means of inferential statistics and machine learning, we combine the sensor data that represent different effects of the physical melting process. Through this combination we expect to enhance the predictive power regarding the usability of the printed parts.

Another working field in the project is establishing robust processes and guidelines for the technology-specific Pre-Process. This covers feedstock handling and physical machine preparation as well as the creation and preparation of the necessary 3D models.

For this endeavor, we team up with different manufacturers that rely on Powder Bed Fusion in order to ensure end-user applicability.
