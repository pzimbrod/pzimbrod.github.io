	abstract = {In this work, a numerical simulation framework is presented based on the
Phase Field Method that is able to capture the evolution of heterogeneous metallic
microstructures during solidification. The involved physics can prove especially
useful when studying not only systems undergoing thermal gradients, such as in
homogeneous systems, but also in conditions that exhibit stark spatial gradients, i.e.
when these inhomogeneities are present even on a mesoscopic scale. To illustrate the
capabilities of the model, in-situ alloying of a High Entropy Alloy during Laser
Powder Bed Fusion is investigated as an exemplary use case. The resulting digital
twin is expected to shorten development times of new materials as well as cut down
on experimental resource needs considerably, therefore contributing to efficient
material qualification processes.},

  abstract = {We present a free and open source implementation of the Finite Volume Method that captures thermal and solute-driven free-surface flows, more commonly known as Marangoni flows. This type of physics commonly appears within many manufacturing processes as well as microfluidic devices and is known to be challenging to resolve. The application includes adaptive mesh refinement and high order WENO schemes in order to substantially save computational cost in multiphase flows where adequate tracking of the phase boundaries is crucial. By accurately simulating the temporal evolution of multiphase flow patterns, unique insight into e.g. the physics of melt pool formation in metal additive manufacturing is possible that is otherwise hard to gain experimentally. We demonstrate our work by a simple two-dimensional benchmark case and outline possible applications with a mesoscopic model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Diffuse interface descriptions offer many advantages for the modeling of microstructure evolution. However, the numerical representation of moving diffuse interfaces on discrete numerical grids involves spurious grid friction, which limits the overall performance of the model in many respects. Interestingly, this intricate and detrimental effect can be overcome in Finite Difference (FD) and Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based implementations by employing the so-called Sharp Phase-Field Method (SPFM). The key idea is to restore the discretization induced broken Translational Invariance (TI) in the discrete phase-field equation by using analytic properties of the equilibrium interface profile. We proof that this method can indeed eliminate spurious grid friction in the three dimensional space. Focussing on homogeneous driving forces, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of spurious grid friction on the overall operational performance of different phase-field models. We show that the SPFM provides superior degrees of interface isotropy with respect to energy and kinetics. The latter property enables the frictionless motion of arbitrarily oriented diffuse interfaces on a fixed 3D grid.},
