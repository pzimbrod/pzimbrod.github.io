	abstract = {In this work, a numerical simulation framework is presented based on the
Phase Field Method that is able to capture the evolution of heterogeneous metallic
microstructures during solidification. The involved physics can prove especially
useful when studying not only systems undergoing thermal gradients, such as in
homogeneous systems, but also in conditions that exhibit stark spatial gradients, i.e.
when these inhomogeneities are present even on a mesoscopic scale. To illustrate the
capabilities of the model, in-situ alloying of a High Entropy Alloy during Laser
Powder Bed Fusion is investigated as an exemplary use case. The resulting digital
twin is expected to shorten development times of new materials as well as cut down
on experimental resource needs considerably, therefore contributing to efficient
material qualification processes.},
