	abstract = {In this work, a numerical simulation framework is presented based on the
Phase Field Method that is able to capture the evolution of heterogeneous metallic
microstructures during solidification. The involved physics can prove especially
useful when studying not only systems undergoing thermal gradients, such as in
homogeneous systems, but also in conditions that exhibit stark spatial gradients, i.e.
when these inhomogeneities are present even on a mesoscopic scale. To illustrate the
capabilities of the model, in-situ alloying of a High Entropy Alloy during Laser
Powder Bed Fusion is investigated as an exemplary use case. The resulting digital
twin is expected to shorten development times of new materials as well as cut down
on experimental resource needs considerably, therefore contributing to efficient
material qualification processes.},

  abstract = {The accurate representation of surface tension driven flows in multi phase systems is considered a challenging problem to resolve numerically. Although there have been extensive works in the past that have presented approaches to resolve these so called Marangoni flows at the phase boundaries, the question of how to efficiently resolve the interface in a universal and conservative manner remains largely open in comparison. Such problems are of high practical relevance in many manufacturing processes, especially in the microfluidic regime where capillary effects dominate the local force equilibria. In this work, we present a freely available numerical solver based on the Finite Volume Method that is able to resolve arbitrarily complex, incompressible multi phase systems with the mentioned physics at phase boundaries. An efficient solution with respect to the number of degrees of freedom can be obtained by either using high order WENO stencils or by employing adaptive cell refinement. We demonstrate the capabilities of the solver by investigating a model benchmark case as well as a single track laser melting process that is highly relevant within laser additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Diffuse interface descriptions offer many advantages for the modeling of microstructure evolution. However, the numerical representation of moving diffuse interfaces on discrete numerical grids involves spurious grid friction, which limits the overall performance of the model in many respects. Interestingly, this intricate and detrimental effect can be overcome in Finite Difference (FD) and Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based implementations by employing the so-called Sharp Phase-Field Method (SPFM). The key idea is to restore the discretization induced broken Translational Invariance (TI) in the discrete phase-field equation by using analytic properties of the equilibrium interface profile. We proof that this method can indeed eliminate spurious grid friction in the three dimensional space. Focussing on homogeneous driving forces, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of spurious grid friction on the overall operational performance of different phase-field models. We show that the SPFM provides superior degrees of interface isotropy with respect to energy and kinetics. The latter property enables the frictionless motion of arbitrarily oriented diffuse interfaces on a fixed 3D grid.},
